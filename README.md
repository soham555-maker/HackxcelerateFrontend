# React + Vite Starter Kit

This repository serves as a boilerplate for starting React projects with Vite. Vite is a fast development server and build tool for modern web applications. It offers lightning-fast cold server start, instant hot module replacement (HMR), and incredibly fast bundling. This starter kit provides a solid foundation for your React projects with Vite.

## Getting Started

To get started with this React + Vite setup, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate into the cloned directory:

```bash
cd react-vite-starter
```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and open your default web browser to view the application. You can start building your React application right away!

## Plugins for Fast Refresh

Vite supports two plugins for Fast Refresh: `@vitejs/plugin-react` and `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`. These plugins provide hot module replacement for React components during development, allowing for a smooth and efficient development experience.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

Choose the plugin that best fits your needs and configure it accordingly in your Vite configuration file (`vite.config.js`).
